aye bro i added like a lot of new things to the handler scripts, lots of new syntax for the text documents
read the README over there to learn more

your movement should still work, but just in case, check everything

also the lighthouse paths are in so pushing and pulling can commence

my Dataspace scripts now have a Primary identifier and a secondary one.
	ex) "F:G" = Floor, Grass
	    "F:LP" = Floor, Lighthouse Path


i think that that is it... but yeah lots of new syntax
